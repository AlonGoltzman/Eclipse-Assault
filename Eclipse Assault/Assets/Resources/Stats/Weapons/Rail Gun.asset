  ItemDescription: An electromagnetic railgun system. In order to fit the system onto
    an armored vehicle the muzzle was reduced, and as a result, in order to retain
    efficency, the projectiles were reduced as well, to 45mm rounds. The system will
    propel projectiles to speeds of approx. 2500 meters per second causing lethal
    damage upon impact.
